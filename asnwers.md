1. In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

    Describe() sets up a test suite while it() is responsible for setting up each individual test.

2. What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

    TDD allows the developer to automate testing to aid in the dev process in the long term. If one is testing their components as they write their code it will be worth the extra time investment later one because less bugs should surface as well as the code you have will be developed to include more edge cases ot things that would otherwise break what you are trying to do.

3. Mention three types of automated tests.
    The three types of automated tests are unit testing, integration testing and end to end testing.
